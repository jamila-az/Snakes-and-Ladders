# Snakes and Ladders

!Snakes and Ladders

Welcome to the Snakes and Ladders project! 🐍🪜
Created with AtelierB and ProB 😊

## Logic and Formal Methods
During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to work with Atelier B and ProB, powerful tools for formal specification and verification. By applying logic and formal methods, we ensure correctness, safety, and robustness in our software. These tools allowed me to reason about the game’s behavior, properties, and adherence to rules.

## Overview

This project implements the classic Snakes and Ladders (also known as Chutes and Ladders) board game. The game features:

- A 100-square board with snakes and ladders.
- Random dice rolls to move players.
- Exciting ups and downs as you climb ladders and slide down snakes.
